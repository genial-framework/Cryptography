### Genial/Cryptography

-------
This dependent provides cryptographic tools to securely hash passwords, encrypt sensitive data using the common algorithms such as TripleDES, RSA, Twofish, and many more. This dependent only supports PHP 7 or higher so if you are using PHP 5.* please consider upgrading to the latest stable version of php which is PHP 7.2.0. This dependent is open to anybody that wants to contribute <https://github.com/Genial-Framework/Cryptography/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>.

### Installation

```
composer require genial-framework/cryptography
```

We suggest you use composer as it is quicker and easier. You can direct download the package, but if you do that then you need to create an autoloader to load all the files.

### Reporting Security Leaks

If you have found a security leak in this dependent do not post the exploit as other people will know about it, you should email this exploit to <nenglish0820@outlook> and when we have verified the leak you will send you an email saying that we are working on patching this leak. In the next dependent release it will be patch.
