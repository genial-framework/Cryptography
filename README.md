### Genial/Cryptography

-------
This dependent provides cryptographic tools to securely hash passwords, encrypt sensitive data using the common algorithms such as RSA, Blowfish, Twofish, and many more. This dependent only supports PHP 7 or higher so if you are using PHP 5.* please consider upgrading to the latest stable version of php which is PHP 7.2.0. This dependent is open to anybody that wants to contribute, just fork the repository and submit a pull request.

### Installation

-------
```
composer require genial-framework/cryptography
```

We suggest you use composer as it is quicker and easier. You can direct download the package, but if you do that then you need to create an autoloader to load all the files.

### To Do

-------
- Implement the new Argon2 hashing algorithm
- Implement custom algorithms by Genial (Vero1, and Lovell1)
