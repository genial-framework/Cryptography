Cryptography component to encrypt sensitive information and one-way hash passwords.

-------
## Prerequisites
- PHP > 7.2.0
- [domExtension]Dom extension


-------
```
composer require genial-framework/cryptography
```

We suggest you use composer as it is quicker and easier. You can direct download the package, but if you do that then you need to create an autoloader to load all the files.

### To Do

-------
- Implement the new Argon2 hashing algorithm
- Implement custom algorithms by Genial (Vero1, and Lovell1)
